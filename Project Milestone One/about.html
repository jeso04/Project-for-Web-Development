<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello! My name is Jesse Brand. I am a student with a major in IT at Kennesaw State University. As of early 2024, I am a sophomore who is taking online classes. I was born in Maryland even though my family is from Georgia. Some of my favorite things to do outside of school are to be outside, hang out with my family, and watch movies.</p>
<p>After I graduate, I currently plan to open a chain focusing on electronics for rural communities in the south and mid-west. I choose rural areas as these areas are still mostly still not served by major companies like Walmart or Best Buy. Even if one of these chains ends up opening a location near one of my locations, I should still find a way to compete with them. If this is what I end up not doing, I will probably just open up a local chain serving a mid-sized city like Augusta or Columbus and it's surrounding metropolitan area.</p>
<p>I have been having a great experience so far at Kennesaw State. I have no plan to move to another school as I have been doing well enough here I feel. I have been a great time in this class and hope to finish it very nicely!</p>
